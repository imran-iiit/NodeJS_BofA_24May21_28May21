* Angular is a framework - very organised and well defined structure. Single page app. Advantage of a separate HTML page - Template
* React is more like a library than a framework. Single page app. Only JSX is returned by all components. ESX is much simpler.

To handle the definiencies of both Angular and React --> VueJS (Google) balanced package, popular library ... still growing compared to React/Angular!

* Context APIs - these provide a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

create bookapp in boareact project and create 3 class based components
1. BookStore

    2. book details

load boareact project by:
1. npm run build
2. npm serve
	npm serve —> just a command … coming from package.json “script”{“serve”: actual 	command}

* Copy just the public folder from boareact project with the 2 scripts and put them in a new folder and type:
npm i -g http-server

getbootstrap.com for button/text look and feel… copy in Index.html the CDN link and use the className=‘’ in button, textbox tags etc.

Default project structure is created by: 
First file created : package.json
Then run: npm i

If you look at package.json, babel is the dependency that converts JSX code (ES6 code in React) to JavaScript
Webpack - build/bundle your code —> webpack.config.js 
npm run build  // this is picked from package.json scripts.build command
